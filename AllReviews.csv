5,A great book (Best book for first time novel readers),Adarsha Shetty,"Jul, 2014","This is the first novel in the Harry Potter series written by JK Rowling. Harry Potter series has a third person narration of this  fiction.        The plot of this novel revolves around a young boy named Harry Potter who is born into a family of magical wizards. Due to some very terrible circumstances during his birth, he spends his first few years of his childhood in his aunt Petunia's  house. Then, certain events happen around him, that he himself isn't able to explain.  The boy spends a miserable life at his aunt's house while being bullied by his fat cousin Dudley, until he joins Hogwarts (the school of Witchcraft and Wizardry). Hagrid, a big beefy man from Hogwarts, appears in front of Harry, his Uncle and Aunt, to give Harry an invitation to join Hogwarts and dares his uncle and Aunt to not stop him from joining Hogwarts. Hagrid tells Harry about his past and why he ended up at his aunt's house. He makes Harry understand why there were certain things that happened around his life that he wasn't able to explain before and why he is being invited to join Hogwarts.  He also introduces him into the world of magic, the market of magic folks, their banks, the ministry of the magic folks, etc. . . . Looking at all this, Harry gets very excited about learning magic in Hogwarts. Even though his uncle and aunt show lot of hesitance towards Harry joining Hogwarts, fearing Hagrid they allow him to do so.  To his surprise he finds out that he is already very famous in the school. Strangely he knows many things about magic before even learning about it. He becomes a part of the house Quidditch team (Quidditch is a sport played in Hogwarts), and realises the joy of being a team player, while earning points for the team. He makes many good friends here, who stand by him in very difficult times. He earns a lot of praise from his teachers and friends for doing great things at school, while exhibiting several good qualities like hardwork, leadership, friendship, courage and humility.  	The story deep dives into the world of magic while being very simple and enabling the reader to imagine the story as it is narrated. The reader is able to find joy in the immaculate details of the surroundings in the story, along with humour and suspense throughout. The author makes a great effort to stress the importance of many simple moral values like hardwork, friendship and bravery, through the happenings of Harry Potter's life.  In my opinion, this book is a great one for first time novel readers, as the language is very simple and the narration is extremely lucid throughout, while introducing few rarely used words in everyday conversation and some common words used in Magic. It's also good for professional novel readers, as the story is very interesting with bits and pieces of logical reasoning and mind-boggling magic tricks to keep you engaged.        Some of the ideas from the book that I specifically liked are as follows:           a)	 It's impossible to become friends with someone, unless you and your    friends are together in some tough situation.           b)	 It's impossible to do something until you have the fear of the thing itself.         I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book and I would like to read successive novels      in this series.READ MORE","Certified Buyer, Bangalore"
